<h2>Projects</h2>

<p>I'm a fast-learning Swiss-army-knife kinda guy. What I don't know, I learn. When I run into a problem I research until I find a solution. When it's too much, I reach out to people who know more about things than I do and get help.

I taught myself HTML and CSS a decade ago, I taught myself Drupal 8, Javascript, SASS, Gulp, Git, basically almost everything I know (except PHP, I really only started learning that when I was getting my master's degree).

I've built Wordpress themes and Drupal 8 themes. I built a Drupal 8 theme from scratch to learn what it's all about, I built a D8 theme based on the UIKit base theme for a client now because it was the right choice for their budget and schedule.

I completed a Master's degree online and I've been working from home as a freelancer since June 2017 when I was laid off from my last job so I know how to deal with working remotely and independently, but I also like working on a team and collaborating with others. I live in Ohio so I would need to work remotely. I've got a B.S. in Photojournalism, a B.S. in Video Production, and an M.S. in Interactive Media so really I just love all kinds of visual communication. I'm a mix of technical and creative which I think works great for me because I get to come up with ideas and then know how to implement them.</p>
