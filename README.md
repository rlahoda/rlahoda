# Rob Lahoda
## Front End Web Developer

This repo is for my homepage found at: https://rlahoda.github.io

The site is built through a Gulp workflow to compile Twig templates and SASS files into the final HTML and CSS. The Javascript files are concatenated and minified through the build process as well. The animations are done with the Greensock Animation Platform (GSAP) and include the TweenMax bundle, Text plugin, and EasePack. The icons are SVG images inserted dynamically through a Javascript function based off the ID of the containing element. The site layout is done in CSS Grid with a Flexbox fallback.

The dev folder contains all of the files to build the site. Since Github pages serve from the root of the project, all of the compiled files are located there. In the dev folder are folders containing the SCSS files, Twig templates, images, and scripts for concatenation.
