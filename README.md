This repo is for my homepage found at: https://rlahoda.github.io

The site is built through a Gulp workflow to compile Twig templates and SASS files into the final HTML and CSS. The Javascript files are concatenated and minified through the build process as well. The animations are done with the Greensock Animation Platform (GSAP) and include the TweenMax bundle, Text plugin, and EasePack. The icons are SVG images inserted dynamically through a Javascript function based off the ID of the containing element. The site layout is done in CSS Grid with a Flexbox fallback.
