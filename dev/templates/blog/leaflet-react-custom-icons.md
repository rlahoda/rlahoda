I've always enjoyed travelling and exploring new places. Maps have been a way that I've been able to see what somewhere is like without actually visiting. It's a fun way to plan, dream, explor, and get familiar with an area before I'm able to visit in person. As a result, I've had an interest in mapping projects and development. One of the most popular open-source Javascript libraries out there for mapping is [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/). Playing around with this library led me to start building my project [My Vacation Map](https://myvacationmap.com), a React-based mapping app that lets you add map points to various places and enter information about places you'd like to see, things to do, etc.

Since the project is created in React, I came across the [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) project that is taking the Leaflet library and building a set of React components to make the library easy to use in a React project.
